# openshift-ci-schema
This schema was generated from type definitions in the openshift/ci-tools repository.  It provides specs for user-face APIs such as ci-operator configs and steps.

# Use
The definition is useful for IDEs that support autocompletion and live validation based on schemas.

Only the `openshift-ci-spec.json` is needed - it's a merge of all schemas in ./schemas.  Swagger definition is provided, but it's usefulness is probabaly limited.

Download `openshift-ci-spec.json` to host.  Then configure your IDE.
